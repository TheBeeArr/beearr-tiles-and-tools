# Beearr's Tiles & Tools

This project started as just a way to improve my personal Map-Making experience in Project Zomboid's TilZed/WordlEd/BuildingEd tools. It started with the simple goal of adding tiles to BuildingEd, but evolved into a complete new set of tools for TilZed, as well as a re-work of some existing ones, that will hopefuly make the Map-making process easier and more acessible for everyone.
